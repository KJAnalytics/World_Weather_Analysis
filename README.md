# World_Weather_Analysis
 Weatherpy with Python API's
## Project Overview
- Development of an app utilizing Google Map's openweathermap API to help research and plan customer vacation trips.  The end result is an interective tool to allow the client to select desired temperature ranges.  From there, results will be filtered and locations can be selected around the world.  From there individual cities and hotels can be selected with maps and travel routes identified.  

## Resources
- Data sources: Google Map's OpenWeather API
- Software: Python 3.9.12, Jupyter Notebook 3.1, Numpy, Citipy, Pandas, Requests

##  Outputs
- Folder structure:
 -Weather_Database - Code and .csv files associated with searching weather data and creating heatmaps with weather conditions.  
 -Vacation_Search - code, .csv, and output maps (,png) related to searching the OpenWeather API for target locations based on temperature criteria.
 -Vacation_Itenary - code, .csv and output maps(.png) related to a targeted search based on temp range of 55-88 degrees Farenheit for a client.  Code allows customer to select temp range, select cities by interactivly selecting target cities, pulling local hotels, and then plooting their route.
